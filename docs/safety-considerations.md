# Safety Considerations

## Intended Use
This prototype is intended for educational and exploratory use only. It is not designed, tested, or approved for clinical or emergency medical use.

## Risk Awareness
Improper tourniquet application can result in serious injury. Risks include but are not limited to:
- Insufficient pressure leading to uncontrolled bleeding
- Excessive pressure causing nerve or tissue damage
- Mechanical or electronic failure during use

## Design Approach
Safety considerations inform design decisions such as:
- Avoiding fully autonomous tightening behavior
- Providing user controlled engagement with feedback rather than automatic actuation
- Keeping system complexity low to reduce failure modes

## Limitations
No claims are made regarding medical effectiveness or safety. Validation is limited to bench testing and controlled demonstrations.
