# Problem Statement

## Context
Tourniquets are time critical devices used to control life threatening extremity bleeding. In real use, application quality varies due to stress, limited training, and inconsistent technique.

## Failure Modes
Common failure modes include:
- Under-tightening that fails to occlude blood flow
- Over-tightening that increases the risk of tissue damage
- Difficulty verifying correct tightness without objective feedback

## Design Goal
Develop a prototype that provides objective pressure feedback during tightening to improve consistency and reduce user error.
