Problem Statement
Context

Tourniquets are time critical devices used to control life threatening extremity bleeding. In real use, application quality varies due to stress, limited training, and inconsistent technique.

This document reflects the problem framing used during Prototype 2, developed as a continuation of an earlier design iteration with an emphasis on sensing and feedback feasibility rather than clinical performance.

Failure Modes

Common failure modes include:

Under-tightening that fails to occlude blood flow

Over-tightening that increases the risk of tissue damage

Difficulty verifying correct tightness without objective feedback

Design Goal

Develop a Prototype 2 system that explores providing objective pressure feedback during tightening to improve consistency and reduce user error.
