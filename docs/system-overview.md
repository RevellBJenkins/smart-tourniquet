# System Overview

## System Objective
The objective of this system is to assist users in applying a tourniquet with more consistent pressure by combining a mechanical tightening mechanism with embedded sensing and user feedback.

## Subsystems
The prototype is divided into the following subsystems:

### Mechanical Subsystem
Responsible for applying and maintaining tension around the limb through a tightening mechanism.

### Sensing Subsystem
Measures applied pressure or force using an embedded sensor to provide objective feedback.

### Control Logic
Processes sensor input and determines system state relative to predefined pressure thresholds.

### User Feedback
Provides simple visual or tactile indicators to communicate system status to the user.

## Constraints
The system is designed as a low complexity prototype intended for educational and exploratory purposes.
