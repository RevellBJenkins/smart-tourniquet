System Overview
System Objective

The objective of Prototype 2 was to assist users in applying a tourniquet with more consistent pressure by combining a mechanical tightening mechanism with embedded sensing and user feedback, and to evaluate whether the selected sensing approach was suitable for this purpose.

Subsystems

The prototype was divided into the following subsystems:

Mechanical Subsystem

Responsible for applying and maintaining tension around the limb through a tightening mechanism.

Sensing Subsystem

Intended to measure applied pressure or force using an embedded sensor to provide objective feedback.

Control Logic

Processes sensor input and determines system state relative to predefined pressure thresholds.

User Feedback

Provides simple visual or tactile indicators to communicate system status to the user.

Constraints

The system was designed as a low complexity prototype intended for educational and exploratory purposes. Design and evaluation were constrained by sensor capability, mechanical integration, and the limited scope of Prototype 2.
