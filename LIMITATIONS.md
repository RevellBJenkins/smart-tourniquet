# Prototype 2 Limitations

Prototype 2 was intentionally limited in scope to isolate sensor behavior. Known limitations include:

- No mechanical tightening or load regulation was implemented.
- Pressure application was not representative of real-world tourniquet use.
- Sensor performance was evaluated only under controlled and simplified conditions.
- The enclosure did not simulate full mechanical coupling found in a deployed device.
- Validation was limited to bench-level testing.

These limitations were accepted as part of Prototype 2’s objective to evaluate sensor feasibility prior to further system development.
