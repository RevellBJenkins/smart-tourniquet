Smart Self-Tightening Tourniquet — Prototype 2
Overview

This repository documents Prototype 2 of a Smart Self-Tightening Tourniquet, developed as a collaborative group engineering project during Winter Break. The project explores the feasibility of integrating pressure sensing and user feedback into a mechanical tourniquet system to improve consistency and safety during application.

This prototype is a continuation of an earlier design iteration and focuses on system integration and sensor evaluation rather than final device performance.

Project Scope

This project is an educational and exploratory prototype. It is not a medical device and has not undergone clinical validation, regulatory review, or safety certification. The work presented here is intended solely for academic and engineering learning purposes.

High-Level Concept

The system combines a mechanical tightening mechanism with embedded pressure sensing and basic control logic. User feedback is provided to indicate when applied pressure falls within an intended range, with the goal of reducing reliance on subjective user judgment during application.

Project Status

Prototype 2 is no longer under active development. This repository serves as a record of the design decisions, implementation attempts, and evaluation results associated with this iteration.
Any code present reflects exploratory sensor testing conducted during Prototype 2 and is not intended to represent a complete system.


Prototype 2 Conclusion
As a result of system evaluation and testing, Prototype 2 did not meet sensing and integration requirements due to limitations in sensor selection. Further development on this iteration was halted, and the prototype was formally concluded in favor of revisiting sensing strategy and system architecture in a future iteration.


Prototype 2 was intended to evaluate the feasibility of integrating pressure sensing into a self-tightening tourniquet system and to assess whether the selected sensing approach could provide reliable and meaningful feedback within the expected pressure range.

Outcome

While portions of the mechanical and control architecture were successfully assembled, the prototype did not meet sensing requirements. The selected pressure sensor was not suitable for the operational range and resolution needed for consistent and interpretable feedback.

Root Cause

The primary limitation was incorrect sensor selection, which prevented accurate pressure measurement under realistic loading conditions. This limitation constrained the ability to evaluate higher-level control behavior and user feedback logic.

Decision

As a result, Prototype 2 was formally concluded, and further development was halted in favor of revisiting sensing strategy and system architecture in a future iteration.

Team

This repository reflects a collaborative group effort. Individual contributions correspond to specific design, integration, and evaluation tasks completed during the Prototype 2 development period.

Prototype 2 intentionally excluded mechanical tightening and focused solely on evaluating pressure sensor behavior within a designed enclosure.
