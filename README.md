# Smart Self-Tightening Tourniquet

## Overview
This repository contains a group engineering project focused on the design of a self-tightening tourniquet with integrated pressure monitoring and user feedback. The goal is to improve consistency and safety during application by reducing reliance on subjective user judgment.

## Project Scope
This project is an educational and exploratory prototype. It is not a medical device and has not undergone clinical validation or regulatory review.

## High-Level Concept
The system combines a mechanical tightening mechanism with embedded pressure sensing and basic control logic. Feedback is provided to indicate when applied pressure falls within an intended range.

## Team
This is a collaborative group project. Individual contributions will be documented as development progresses.
